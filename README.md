# Iris-Statistical-Analysis
In this project, we analyze and interpret statistical data using Python and various data science libraries. We focus on the well-known Iris dataset, which contains measurements of flower characteristics from three different species of iris: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica.
The project involves using Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to:
•	Understand the structure of the data
•	Summarize it using descriptive statistics
•	Perform inferential statistical tests (such as t-tests and ANOVA)
•	Analyze relationships between features through correlation
This project demonstrates how statistical techniques and data visualization can help us draw insights from real-world datasets and make data-driven decisions.
